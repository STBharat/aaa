            â€¢ **Subsistence farming**: Small-scale agriculture practiced by local communities who clear forest patches for cultivation
            
            The underlying causes are often complex and interconnected, including economic pressures, weak governance, unclear land tenure, corruption, and market demands for commodities.
            
            Different regions face different primary drivers - in the Amazon, cattle ranching and soy production are major factors, while in Southeast Asia, palm oil plantations are a significant cause.

        â€¢ Forests are crucial **carbon sinks**, absorbing about 2.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually - nearly one-third of emissions from burning fossil fuels
        
        â€¢ When forests are destroyed, this stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere. Deforestation contributes approximately 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions
        
        â€¢ Beyond carbon storage, forests regulate regional rainfall patterns and temperature. Massive deforestation in the Amazon, for instance, is altering rainfall patterns across South America
        
        â€¢ Forests also help communities adapt to climate change impacts by preventing soil erosion, reducing flooding, and providing natural cooling
        
        The relationship works both ways - as climate change accelerates, forests face increased threats from droughts, wildfires, pest outbreaks, and extreme weather events.
        
        This creates a dangerous feedback loop: climate change damages forests, reducing their capacity to mitigate climate change, which in turn leads to more forest degradation.

        â€¢ Support indigenous communities' land rights - indigenous-managed forests show lower deforestation rates

        â€¢ **Layered habitats**: The complex vertical structure of forests (forest floor, understory, canopy, emergent layer) creates countless ecological niches

        â€¢ Edge effects expose interior forest species to new conditions they can't tolerate
        â€¢ Local extinctions can trigger cascade effects through food webs
